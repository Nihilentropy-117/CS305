Artemis Financial needed help securing their software, which had vulnerabilities in cryptography and input validation that left sensitive financial data exposed.

I addressed the issues methodically. 
I replaced weak cryptography with SHA-256 and improved code structure to limit exposure of critical functions.

The vulnerability assessment process gave structure to the work. Input validation and cryptography were straightforward to address.

To increase security, I added layers like stronger hashing, error handling, and clean design. Future assessments will lean on tools OWASP for dynamic testing, paired with manual reviews.

After refactoring, I used unit tests, integration tests, and static analysis to confirm the code was secure and functional. Dependency scans helped ensure no new vulnerabilities were introduced.

For future, Iâ€™d highlight the refactored code, assessment documentation, and test results. They show I can identify and fix vulnerabilities effectively, keeping software secure without overcomplicating the process.
